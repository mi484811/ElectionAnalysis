## Summary
With such a high voting count in the Denver precinct, one wonders how significant the precinct is and if it should be broken into another precinct. One would think that gerrymandering would be something occurring in this precinct. The code can be refactored to integrate other factors such as race and ethnicity and see the trends of voters according to ethnicity vs. race.
